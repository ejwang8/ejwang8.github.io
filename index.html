    <!-- My Journey / Experience -->
    <section>
        <h3>My Journey</h3>
        <p><strong>Computational Biology Research Internship:</strong> During my research internship, I worked with <strong>Jupyter Notebooks</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Pandas</strong>, and <strong>regex</strong> to analyze biological data. This experience deepened my love for data analysis and solidified my foundation in working with large datasets.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Computational Biology Internship at Robigo (AgTech Startup):</strong> At Robigo, I applied bioinformatics tools like <strong>Bowtie</strong> and contributed to a project that automated <strong>market sizing</strong> in <strong>Excel</strong> using <strong>Google Apps Script</strong>. This internship was a fantastic opportunity to apply what I learned in computational biology to real-world applications.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Summer Associate Consultant & Full-Time at Clarion (Lumanity):</strong> As a consultant at Clarion, I developed strong qualitative skills through market research while enhancing my quantitative data analysis capabilities. I also automated workflows in <strong>Excel</strong> (using macros) to improve efficiency in analyzing large datasets, providing actionable insights to clients.</p>

        <p><strong>International Client Work:</strong> I worked with an international client in biotech consulting, contributing to the greenlighting of a <strong>Phase 2 clinical trial for stroke therapy</strong>. My analysis helped select the therapy over other candidates in the pipeline, demonstrating the critical role of data in shaping strategic decisions.</p>
